**Actual Solutions:**

Below are the full detailed solutions for each problem to be used by the Comparison Agents during analysis.

---

#### **Problem 1 Actual Solution:**

**Answer:** 79

**Solution:**

The airlines are called A100, A120, and A150, labeled by the frequency of their departures.

1. **Calculating the LCM:**
   - The LCM of 100, 120, and 150 is 600 days.

2. **Analyzing Flight Schedules:**
   - Consider all possible departure times within the 600-day cycle.
   - The departures of the airlines occur at multiples of their respective intervals.

3. **Finding Maximum Gap:**
   - By examining various scenarios, we find that the maximum number of consecutive days without any flights is **79 days**.
   - This occurs multiple times within the 600-day cycle, regardless of the initial departure times.

tures. We first prove that there is a period of 99 days after an A100 departure during which no
A150 plane takes off.
Consideraperiodof301dayswhichstartswithanA150departureonDay0,followedbyadeparture
on Day 150 and on Day 300. Let the first A100 departure in this period be on Day x.
There are two possibilities: (i) 0 ≤ x ≤ 50 or (ii) 51 ≤ x ≤ 99. In case (i), there is a quiet period
of 99 days after the first A100 departure. In case (ii), the second A100 departure will be on Day
100+x where 151≤100+x≤199 so there will be a period of 99 consecutive days after the second
A100 departure with no A150 departure.
We will now prove that there are 79 consecutive days on which no departure of any airline happens,
includingtheA120planes. WerestarttimeanddefineDay0tobewhenanA100flightdepartsand
there is no A150 flight before Day 100. This situation will repeat later because 300 = 3×100 =
2×150. The fourth A100 flight will take off on Day 300 and there will be no subsequent departure
of an A150 plane before Day 400.
Suppose the first departure of an A120 plane is on Day y. If y ≤ 20 or y ≥ 80, we have found the
79 consecutive days by looking after or before this A120 departure.
If 20 ≤ y ≤ 60, then there will be an A120 departure on day 240+y where 260 ≤ 240+y ≤ 300
so there will be no A120 departure strictly between Day 300 and Day 380 and so we will find the
required 79 consecutive quiet days between those dates.
Finally,if61≤y ≤80,therewillbeanA120departureonDayy+240where301≤y+240≤320and
therewillbenosubsequentdeparturesbeforeDay400andagainwefindtherequired79consecutive

We now show that this bound can be attained. Suppose that an A100 departs on Day 0, an A120
departs on Day 80 and an A150 departs on Day 120. The departure days are then:
0,80,100,120,200&200,270,300,320,400,420,440,500,560,570
modulo 600 (i.e. it repeats every 600 days).
The longest run of consecutive days without flights is 79 days (and this is obtained three times in
this 600 day cycle).

Having established this tangency, we now perform a short calculation.
Let Γ denote the circle with centre C and radius CX which passes through Y. The point E is on
the radical axis XY of ω and Γ. It follows that E has equal powers with respect to both circles ω
and Γ.
Let x=BE so EC =108−x. The power of E with respect to ω is x2 (because of the tangency at
B) and the power of E with respect to Γ is EC2−XC2 because C is the centre of Γ and XC is its
radius.
We have

and 102024+2 times in a row results in two numbers divisible by n."	143	"LetM =101024. Letabeanythree-digitnumber. WritingM copiesofainarowresults
in a number X where
X =a×100100100...1001001
and there are M copies of the digit one in the long number. If instead we wrote M +2 copies of a
in a row, the resulting number would be 106X +1001a. We use the notation (u,v) to denote the
greatest common divisor of two integers u and v which are not both 0.
We apply Euclid’s algorithm so
((106X+1001a),X)=(1001a,X).
It is therefore a necessary condition that our three-digit number n should divide (1001a,X) for all
three-digit numbers a. By considering a = 100 and a = 101, we see that any candidate for n must
divide 1001×101−1001×100 = 1001. Moreover, if n is a divisor of 1001, then n will divide X
because 1001 divides 10010010010...01001001 which is
1001×10000010000010...01000001.
The second factor involves M/2 copies of the digit one. Such an n will also divide 106X+1001a.
Thus it is a necessary and sufficient condition for n to satisfy the conditions of the problem that n
be a three-digit divisor of 1001 (=7×11×13). There is a unique such number: 143.

then erases ten of them. The mean of the remaining numbers is 3000/37. The sum of the numbers
Bob erased is S. What is the remainder when n×S is divided by 997?"	902	"Let T be the sum of the numbers, after Bob has erased 10 of them. We can bound T
by considering what happens if Bob happens to erase the smallest ten numbers, or the largest ten
numbers.
The average of the set {1,2,...,n−10} is n−9 (the average of the first and last terms of a finite
2
arithmetic progression). Similarly, average of the set {11,12,...,n} is n+11. The average of the

remaining numbers, 3000 = T , must be bounded by these quantities, so

2 n−10 37 2
It follows that n−10 must be a multiple of 37 so that it can cancel down to 37. Another way to
say that is n≡10 mod 37. Multiplying the inequalities by 2 we obtain
6000
n−9≤ ≤n+11

Bob can achieve this by erasing {51,52,...,59,66}.
The number that we must report is n×S modulo 997, which is 158×561 modulo 997, which is

(a,b)+(b,c)+(c,a)≤2a+b≤a+b+c−2
because a≤c−2. Therefore G(a,b,c)+1<a+b+c.
Next we tackle the case n=4, and let the positive integers be a<b<c<d. Now

For each 1 ≤ i ≤ N, if (for contradiction) a = 0, then i divides a and so a ̸= 0, which is absurd.
i i i
Therefore the first N terms of the sequence are non-zero (including a ), and all subsequent terms

are 0 because if i > N, then i cannot divide any of the first N terms which are all non-zero and

In the case that N = 2 this yields the second and third delightful sequences mentioned above, and
proves that there are no others.
It remains to study the case N > 2. In that case, N −1 does not divide N so, taking j as above,
we must have a =N −1 (̸=1). If (for contradiction) a ≥2 there is an index k with 1<k ≤N

can be calculated by labelling the matches 1 to m. Label the players in order 1 to 2m (this can be
done in (2m)! ways), and assign players (2i−1) and 2i to match number i.

Swappingthelabelsofanypair2i−1,2idoesnotchangethepairings,nordoespermutingtheorder

(2m)! is overcounting the number of first round pairings by a factor of 2m(m!).
Therefore the number of first round pairings is
(2m)!
.
2mm!
Now consider the odd and even factors in the product defining (2m)! separately. We see that
(2m)!=[(2m)·2(m−1)···2]×[(2m−1)·(2m−3)···3·1].
The product of the odd numbers (2m−1)·(2m−3)···3·1 is often written as (2m−1)!!. Pulling
factors of 2 out of the even factors we obtain
(2m)!=2m·m!·(2m−1)!!.
Therefore the number of different first round pairings is
(2m)!
=(2m−1)!!.
2m·m!
The number of first round pairings of the 4048=2n+2 players where Fred and George do not play
each other is the total number of pairings minus the number of pairings in which they play each
other. This is (2n+1)!!−(2n−1)!!=2n(2n−1)!!=4046·4045!!. This number is clearly divisible
by 125 because of the large number of factors of 5 in 4045!!. We would like to know the remainder
when 4046·4045!! is divided by 8, because then we could apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem
and deduce the remainder on division by 1000. Note that 4045×4043×4041≡5×3×1≡−1 mod
8. The sequence of odd positive integers has period 4 modulo 8, and 4039 ≡ 7 mod 8. Notice that
1×3×5×7 ≡ 1 mod 8. Running the sequence of odd numbers from 1 to 4039 cycles through a
whole number of periods modulo 8 and so 4039!!≡1 mod 8. Now 4046·4045!!≡6×(−1)×1≡2
mod 8.
By the Chinese remainder theorem there is a unique integer x in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 999 which
satisfies our conditions modulo 8 and modulo 125, and by inspection that is 250 and so
4046·4045!!≡250 mod 1000

Therefore for each integer k in the range 0≤k ≤10100−1 we have S(k)+S(10100−1−k)=900.
Recall that N =10100−2 and observe that S(0)=0. Then
2(S(0)+S(1)+S(2)+···+S(10100−1))=900×10100
