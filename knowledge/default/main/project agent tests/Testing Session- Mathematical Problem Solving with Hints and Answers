### **Problems, Correct Answers, and Hints:**

#### **Problem 1:**

**Problem Statement:**

Three airline companies operate flights from Dodola island. Each company has a different schedule of departures. The first company departs every 100 days, the second every 120 days, and the third every 150 days. What is the greatest positive integer \( d \) for which it is true that there will be \( d \) consecutive days without a flight from Dodola island, regardless of the departure times of the various airlines?

**Correct Answer:** The greatest positive integer \( d \) is **79 days**.

**Hint:** Consider the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the departure intervals and analyze the maximum gap between flights within a cycle.

---

#### **Problem 2:**

**Problem Statement:**

Let triangle \( ABC \) have sides \( BC = 108 \), \( CA = 126 \), and \( AB = 39 \). Point \( X \) lies on segment \( AC \) such that \( BX \) bisects angle \( \angle ABC \). Let \( \omega \) be the circumcircle of triangle \( ABX \). Let \( Y \) be a point on \( \omega \) different from \( X \) such that \( CX = CY \). Line \( XY \) meets \( BC \) at \( E \). The length of segment \( BE \) can be written as \( \dfrac{m}{n} \), where \( m \) and \( n \) are coprime positive integers. Find \( m + n \).

**Correct Answer:** \( m + n = 751 \).

**Hint:** Use the Angle Bisector Theorem and properties of circles, particularly the Power of a Point theorem.

---

#### **Problem 3:**

**Problem Statement:**

Triangle \( ABC \) has side length \( AB = 120 \) and circumradius \( R = 100 \). Let \( D \) be the foot of the perpendicular from \( C \) to the line \( AB \). What is the greatest possible length of segment \( CD \)?

**Correct Answer:** The greatest possible length of \( CD \) is **180 units**.

**Hint:** Consider the relationship between the circumradius, side lengths, and angles of a triangle. Utilize the Law of Sines and properties of right triangles to find the maximum length.

#### **Problem 4:**

**Problem Statement:**

Find the three-digit number \( n \) such that writing any other three-digit number \( 10^{2024} \) times in a row and \( 10^{2024} + 2 \) times in a row results in two numbers divisible by \( n \).

**Correct Answer:** \( n = 143 \).

**Hint:** Explore the divisibility properties of repeating numbers and consider factors of numbers like \( 1001 \).

---

#### **Problem 5:**

**Problem Statement:**

Alice writes all positive integers from \( 1 \) to \( n \) on the board for some positive integer \( n \geq 11 \). Bob then erases ten of them. The mean of the remaining numbers is \( \dfrac{3000}{37} \). The sum of the numbers Bob erased is \( S \). What is the remainder when \( n \times S \) is divided by \( 997 \)?

**Correct Answer:** The remainder is **902**.

**Hint:** Set up equations based on the total sum of numbers, the sum of the erased numbers, and the mean of the remaining numbers. Solve for \( n \) and \( S \), then compute \( n \times S \mod 997 \).

---

#### **Problem 6:**

**Problem Statement:**

For positive integers \( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n \), define \( G(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \) to be the sum of their \( \dfrac{n(n - 1)}{2} \) pairwise greatest common divisors. We say that an integer \( n \geq 2 \) is **artificial** if there exist \( n \) different positive integers \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that
\[
a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n = G(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) + 1.
\]
Find the sum of all artificial integers \( m \) in the range \( 2 \leq m \leq 40 \).

**Correct Answer:** The sum is **810**.

**Hint:** Investigate small values of \( n \) to find patterns. Show that if \( n = 5 \) is artificial, then \( n + 1 \) is also artificial. Use induction to find all artificial numbers in the given range.

We call a sequence \( a_1, a_2, \dots \) of non-negative integers **delightful** if there exists a positive integer \( N \) such that for all \( n > N \), \( a_n = 0 \), and for all \( i \geq 1 \), \( a_i \) counts the number of multiples of \( i \) in \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N \). How many delightful sequences of non-negative integers are there?

**Correct Answer:** There are **3** delightful sequences.

**Hint:** Analyze small values of \( N \) and consider the constraints imposed by the definition. Look for sequences where \( N = 1 \) or \( N = 2 \).

**Problem Statement:**

Fred and George take part in a tennis tournament with 4046 other players. In each round, the players are paired into 2024 matches. How many ways are there to arrange the first round such that Fred and George do not have to play each other? (Two arrangements for the first round are different if there is a player with a different opponent in the two arrangements.)

**Correct Answer:** The number of ways is congruent to **250 modulo 1000**.

**Hint:** Calculate the total number of pairings without restrictions and subtract the number where Fred and George play each other. Use factorials and combinations, and compute the final answer modulo 1000.

For a positive integer \( n \), let \( S(n) \) denote the sum of the digits of \( n \) in base 10. Compute \( S(S(1) + S(2) + \dots + S(N)) \) with \( N = 10^{100} - 2 \).

**Correct Answer:** The result is **891**.

**Hint:** Use properties of digit sums and symmetry. Consider pairing numbers whose digit sums add up to a constant value. Calculate the total sum and then compute its digit sum.

**Problem Statement:**

The Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows: \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1} \) for \( n \geq 1 \). There are \( N \) positive integers \( n \) strictly less than \( 10^{101} \) such that \( n^2 + (n + 1)^2 \) is a multiple of 5 but \( F_{n-1}^2 + F_n^2 \) is not. How many prime factors does \( N \) have, counted with multiplicity?

**Correct Answer:** \( N \) has **201** prime factors when counted with multiplicity.
