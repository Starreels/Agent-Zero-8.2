Merger & Entry
Description
Note: This is the second AIMO Progress Prize competition. It builds upon the first AIMO Progress Prize competition, which was won in July 2024 by Project Numina. This second competition has an increased prize pool, a new dataset of problems, increased compute for participants and updated rules for using open-source LLMs.

The ability to reason mathematically is a critical milestone for AI. Mathematical reasoning is the foundation for solving many complex problems, from engineering marvels to intricate financial models. However, current AI capabilities are limited in this area.

The AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO) Prize is a $10mn fund to spur the open development of AI models capable of performing as well as top human participants in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO).

This second AIMO Progress Prize competition has 110 math problems in algebra, combinatorics, geometry and number theory. The difficulty has been increased from the first competition, and the problems are now around the National Olympiad level. The problems have also been designed to be 'AI hard' in terms of the mathematical reasoning required, which was tested against current open LLMs' capabilities.

To address the challenge of train-test leakage, the competition uses novel math problems created by an international team of problem solvers. Using this transparent and fair evaluation framework, the competition will help to strengthen the benchmarks for assessing AI models' mathematical reasoning skills, without the risk of contamination from training data.
This latest AIMO Progress Prize competition offers an exciting opportunity to drive innovation in the field of AI for Math, while also fostering healthy competition and supporting open science.

Join us as we work towards a future where AI models‚Äô mathematical reasoning skills are accurately and reliably assessed, driving progress and innovation.

Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated on the accuracy between their predicted labels and the ground-truth labels. In other words, submissions are ranked by the fraction of predicted labels that exactly match the ground-truth labels.

In this competition, every ground-truth label is an integer between 0 and 999, inclusive.

You should arrive at this number by taking the problem solution modulo 1000. If, for instance, you believe the solution to a problem is 65521 should be reported as 521 and -900 should be reported as 100. To be clear, for positive integers larger than 1000, this means: report the last three digits, discarding any initial zero(s). Thus 1009 should be reported as 9.

If a question asks for an answer ùëé
 to be calculated modulo ùëö
 where ùëö
 is specified (not all questions are of this type), then calculate the residue ùëé
 modulo ùëö
 which is ùëé‚Ä≤
 with 0‚â§ùëé‚Ä≤<ùëö
 and then report this answer modulo 1000
. For example, if asked to calculate the positive integer 2025
 modulo 999
, the final answer should be 27
. However, if asked to calculate 2025
 modulo 1013
, the final answer should be 12
.

Answers may require basic computations, e.g., ‚åä1002‚Äæ‚àö‚åã=141
.

Submitting
You must submit to this competition using the provided Python evaluation API, which serves test set instances one-by-one in random order. To use the API, follow the template in this notebook.

Prizes
TOTAL FUND FOR PROGRESS PRIZE 2: $2,117,152

Prizes for Top-Ranking Teams in this Competition:
1st Place: $262,144
2nd Place: $131,072
3rd Place: $65,536
4th Place: $32,768
5th Place: $16,384

Overall Progress Prize Winner: The Overall Progress Prize Winner shall be the highest ranking team that achieves a score of at least 47/50 on both public and private test sets. After any prizes for the five top-ranking teams have been awarded, the remainder of the total fund shall be awarded to the Overall Progress Prize Winner.

If a team is named the Overall Progress Prize Winner in this competition, the prize will be at least $1,589,248. If no team is named the Overall Progress Prize Winner in this competition, the remainder of the total fund shall roll over to the next competition, where the same prize allocation will apply.

Early Sharing Prize: $20,000. An additional $20,000 cash prize will be awarded for sharing high-scoring public notebooks early in the competition to encourage participants to share information earlier and help the community make more progress over the course of the competition.

To be eligible for the Early Sharing Prize, you will need to:

1) Be the first to publish a public notebook scoring at least 20/50 on the leaderboard before January 1st, 2025, 11:59 PM UTC.

2) Out of all participants or Teams who have submitted notebooks scoring at least 20/50, be the first to make your notebook public. The public notebook needs to adhere to the same requirements and restrictions regarding licensing, reproducibility, and documentation to which the winning Submission is subject (see Competition Rules).

3) Keep the notebooks and any datasets they use publicly available until the final Progress Prizes are awarded to the winning Teams at the end of the competition.

The Competition Sponsor will, after 1 January 2025, 11:59 PM UTC, assess all Submissions that are eligible for the Early Sharing Prize in the order in which Submissions were made. If it is discovered that such a Submissions that scored more than 20 points has no or incomplete documentation, incompatible licensing, or is in any other way incompatible with the rules to which the winning Submission is subject, it will not be considered towards the Early Sharing Prize and the next Submissions will be assessed.

 or using LaTeX \ùöåùöçùöòùöù
 command for ùë•‚ãÖùë¶
 or LaTeX \ùöùùöíùöñùöéùöú
 command for ùë•√óùë¶
.
ùëõ!
 for an integer represents the factorial function ùëõ!=ùëõ‚ãÖ(ùëõ‚àí1)‚ãÖ(ùëõ‚àí2)‚ãØ2‚ãÖ1
.
log
, sin
, cos
 are generally in math mode.

 or inline using ùëé/ùëè
.
|ùë•|
 represents the absolute value of ùë•
, eg, |‚àí2|=2
.
Standard geometric notation is used such as the triangle ‚ñ≥ùê¥ùêµùê∂
 with sides ùê¥ùêµ
, ùêµùê∂
, and ùê¥ùê∂
. Standard notation is also used for angles, eg, ‚à†ùê¥ùêµùê∂
. Angles may be specified in degrees ‚à†ùê¥ùêµùê∂=60‚àò
.
Standard trigonometric operators including sin
, cos
, tan
 may be used.
Sets are denoted using standard curly bracket notation, eg, {1,2,3}
.
‚åäùë•‚åã
 represents the integer part of the real number ùë•
 ie the greatest integer less than or equal to ùë•
. ‚åàùë•‚åâ
 represents the smallest integer greater than or equal to ùë•
. {ùë•}
 for a single value ùë•
 refers to the fractional part of the real number ùë•
 ie ùë•‚àí‚åäùë•‚åã
.
\ùöïùöéùöèùöù
 and \ùöõùöíùöêùöëùöù
 may be used in conjunction with other LaTeX commands eg \ùöïùöéùöèùöù \ùöïùöåùöéùöíùöï \ùöèùöõùöäùöå{ùö°}{ùü∏}\ùöõùöíùöêùöëùöù\ùöõùöåùöéùöíùöï

 eg with ùëé=1
, ùëè=2
: ùëéùëè‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ=12
 and ùëèùëéùëè‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ=212
.
(ùëéùëè)
 is interpreted as the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways of choosing ùëè
 elements from a set of size ùëé
.
‚Ñï,‚Ñ§,‚Ñö
, and ‚Ñù
 are used to denote the set of positive integers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers, respectively (where positive means >0
).
We allow informal probability language such as: a point is chosen uniformly at random in the interval [0,1]
.
The sum over the empty set is 0
, and the product over the empty set is 1
.
For integers ùëô
, ùëö
, and ùëõ
, ùëôùëöùëõ
 denotes ùëô(ùëöùëõ)
.
British or American versions of English can be used. Thus ''highest common factor'' means the same as ''greatest common divisor''.
A prefix or subscript may be used to indicate features of a triangle associated with vertices. Thus triangle ùê¥ùêµùê∂
 has three altitudes, and the one dropped from ùê¥
 could be denoted the altitude through ùê¥
, the ùê¥
-altitude or the altitude ‚Ñéùëé
. Similarly, for median lines.
:=
 means 'is defined to be equal to'.
Note on taxonomy: An equilateral triangle is a specific type of isosceles triangle, a square is a specific type of rectangle, and a rectangle is a specific type of parallelogram, among other similar relationships.
The word trapezium can mean different things in different countries. For the purposes of this competition, a trapezium is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel opposite sides.
